## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This project required extensive use with React state. I initially began by creating functions to handle game events and tested those functions with Jest, but a lot of those functions became obsolete due to the way that React renders objects. This project was great, though, as I became much more familiar with React hooks like useState and useEffect.

### Continued development

I plan to focus on learning how to test React code next, to help prevent code from becoming too tightly coupled and to speed up the development of interactive applications. I may also look into Redux for better state management.
